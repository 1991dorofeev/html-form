            <h3>Why should I use Squadhelp?</h3>
            <span>You always have an option of hiring a consultant or coming up with the name yourself. However, Squadhelp builds great brands that succeed faster by connecting you with the most creative people across the globe. Most importantly, Squadhelp provides you with choice: you get to see ideas from dozens (in some cases, hundreds) of contestants before you select a winner. Typically, you would spend far less money with Squadhelp (our contests start at $199) than hiring an agency. Also, you will receive immediate results - most contests begin receiving submissions within minutes of starting.</span>
